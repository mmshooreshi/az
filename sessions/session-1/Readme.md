# Session 1 · Front-End Playground 🚀

Welcome! In this very first session you will:

1. Spin up a zero-config dev server in 3 seconds.
2. Play with Tailwind’s utility classes for **motion** & **shapes**.
3. Trigger DOM events (`dragenter`, `canplay`, `dblclick`) and see what they do.

## ▶️ Run the mini-site locally

Open VS Code, then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>~</kbd> to pop a terminal.

```bash
# any Python ≥ 3.7 works
python3 -m http.server 8000
# …or, on Windows if “python” maps to 3.x:
python -m http.server 8000
````

Now visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and click around (start with *index.html*).

> **Tip:** the server auto-reloads when you save files—no extra tools needed for tiny demos.
